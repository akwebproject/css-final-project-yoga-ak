        Pranayama is a core yogic practice involving the conscious control and regulation of breath to influence the life force, or prana, believed to sustain physical and mental well-being.  Rooted in ancient Indian traditions, it is the fourth limb of Patanjali’s eight-limbed yoga path, serving as a preparatory step for 
        meditation and deeper states of awareness. The term comes from Sanskrit: prana meaning "vital energy" and ayama meaning "control, extension, or expansion.".

      <mark>Alternate Nostril Breathing </mark>, also known as Nadi Shodhana or channel-cleaning breath,
       is an ancient yogic breathing technique that involves consciously breathing through one nostril 
       at a time while alternately closing the other with the fingers. 

        Purpose & Benefits: It helps calm the nervous system, reduce stress and anxiety,
      and improve focus and concentration by activating the parasympathetic nervous system.  
      Studies suggest it can lower heart rate, blood pressure, and improve respiratory function.  
I       t’s also used as a preparation for meditation to promote mental clarity and inner balance.

        <mark>Humming Bee Breathing</mark>, or Bhramari Pranayama, is a powerful yogic breathing technique that calms the mind, reduces anxiety, and activates the parasympathetic nervous system for deep relaxation.  The practice involves making a soft, humming sound during exhalation—like a bee—to create soothing vibrations in the head and brain. It’s especially effective for stress relief, improving focus, and preparing the mind for meditation.

<mark>Sheetali Pranayama</mark>, also known as Cooling Breath, is a traditional yogic breathing technique designed to reduce internal heat, 
calm the nervous system, and soothe emotional agitation.  It works by inhaling air through a curled tongue, which creates a 
cooling sensation, followed by exhalation through the nostrils. This practice is especially beneficial during hot weather, 
for managing acidity, high blood pressure, or emotional stress.
